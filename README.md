Analysis
We conducted six types of analyses to gain insights into the attrition patterns within the company:

Department-wise Attrition:

Objective: To identify which departments have higher attrition rates.
Findings: Departments with high attrition rates may indicate issues such as job dissatisfaction or poor management.
Attrition by Gender:

Objective: To understand if there is a gender disparity in attrition rates.
Findings: Gender-based analysis helps to ensure that the company is providing a fair and supportive work environment for all employees.
Number of Employees by Age Group:

Findings: Analyzing age distribution can help in understanding the career stage of employees and planning retention strategies accordingly.
Job Satisfaction Rating:

Objective: To assess how job satisfaction impacts attrition.
Findings: Low job satisfaction ratings could be a significant factor in employee turnover.
Education Field Wise Attrition:

Objective: To determine if employees from certain education fields are more likely to leave the company.
Findings: Insights from this analysis can help tailor retention programs for employees from different educational backgrounds.
Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups:
